#greets users 
#prompts users for game type
#asks user who should go first/be X
#uses input to initialize Game with appropriate player types and token values
#when game is over, prompt user if they'd like to play again, allow to choose a new config and go again or exit
#You can implement this logic within the bin/tictactoe directly or encapsulate it within Game via a method like #start and simply evoke that method in the CLI. There is no wrong way to implement code that works.
